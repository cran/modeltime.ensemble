Description: 
    A 'modeltime' extension that implements time series ensemble forecasting methods including model averaging, 
    weighted averaging, and stacking. These techniques are popular methods 
    to improve forecast accuracy and stability. Refer to papers such as 
    "Machine-Learning Models for Sales Time Series Forecasting" Pavlyshenko, B.M. (2019) <doi:10.3390>.
